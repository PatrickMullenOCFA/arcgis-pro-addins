## Definition Query Buttons

Buttons to set a definition expression on a layer to the selected features. Similar to Create layer from selection. The only difference is the definition query is placed on the selected layer, not on a newly created layer.

## External Viewer Button

A configureable button that allows a user to open an external application using an ID property and a url. The addin is configured to allow the user to modify the external url, layer name, and id property. By default, the addin is configured to allow opening Beacon, a well known parcel viewer using the layer "Parcel Boundaries" and the id property "PARCELID".
